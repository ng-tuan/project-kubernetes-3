# Coworking Space Service Extension
The Coworking Space Service is a set of APIs that enables users to request one-time tokens and administrators to authorize access to a coworking space. This service follows a microservice pattern and the APIs are split into distinct services that can be deployed and managed independently of one another.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies
#### Local Environment
1. Python Environment - run Python 3.6+ applications and install Python dependencies via `pip`
2. Docker CLI - build and run Docker images locally
3. `kubectl` - run commands against a Kubernetes cluster
4. `helm` - apply Helm Charts to a Kubernetes cluster

#### Remote Resources
1. AWS CodeBuild - build Docker images remotely
2. AWS ECR - host Docker images
3. Kubernetes Environment with AWS EKS - run applications in k8s
4. AWS CloudWatch - monitor activity and logs in EKS
5. GitHub - pull and clone code

### Setup
#### 1. Configure a Database
Pre-requisites:
- Have Kubernetes cluster ready.
- Have `kubectl` installed and configured to interact with your cluster.
- Have Helm installed.

Instructions:
1. Create an EKS Cluster:
   ```bash
   eksctl create cluster --name my-cluster --region us-east-1 --nodegroup-name my-nodes --node-type t3.small --nodes 1 --nodes-min 1 --nodes-max 2
   ```
2. Verify the Installation:
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods
   ```

```
### 2. Running the Analytics Application Locally
In the `analytics/` directory:

1. Install dependencies
```bash
# Update the local package index with the latest packages from the repositories
apt update

# Install a couple of packages to successfully install postgresql server locally
apt install build-essential libpq-dev

# Update python modules to successfully build the required modules
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel

pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. Run the application (see below regarding environment variables)
```bash
<ENV_VARS> python app.py
```

There are multiple ways to set environment variables in a command. They can be set per session by running `export KEY=VAL` in the command line or they can be prepended into your command.

* `DB_USERNAME`
* `DB_PASSWORD`
* `DB_HOST` (defaults to `127.0.0.1`)
* `DB_PORT` (defaults to `5432`)
* `DB_NAME` (defaults to `postgres`)

If we set the environment variables by prepending them, it would look like the following:
```bash
DB_USERNAME=username_here DB_PASSWORD=password_here python app.py
```

3. Verifying The Application
* Generate report for check-ins grouped by dates
`curl <BASE_URL>/api/reports/daily_usage`

* Generate report for check-ins grouped by users
`curl <BASE_URL>/api/reports/user_visits`
